        abstract = {The interaction between genetic drift and selection in shaping genetic diversity is not fully understood. In particular, a population{\textquoteright}s propensity to drift is typically summarized by its long-term effective population size (Ne ), but rapidly changing population demographics may complicate this relationship. To better understand how changing demography impacts selection, we investigated linked selection in the genomes of 23 domesticated maize and 13 wild maize (teosinte) individuals. We show that maize went through a domestication bottleneck with a population size of approximately 5\% that of teosinte before it experienced rapid expansion post-domestication. We observe that hard sweeps on genic mutations are not the primary force driving maize evolution. As expected, a reduced population size during domestication decreased the efficiency of purifying selection to purge deleterious alleles from maize, but rapid expansion after domestication has since increased the efficiency of purifying selection to levels exceeding those seen in teosinte. This final observation demonstrates that rapid demographic change can have wide-ranging impacts on diversity that conflict with would-be expectations based on long-term Ne.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:A} number of different statistics are used for detecting natural selection using {DNA} sequencing data, including statistics that are summaries of the frequency spectrum, such as Tajima's D. These statistics are now often being applied in the analysis of Next Generation Sequencing ({NGS)} data. However, estimates of frequency spectra from {NGS} data are strongly affected by low sequencing coverage; the inherent technology dependent variation in sequencing depth causes systematic differences in the value of the statistic among genomic {regions.RESULTS:We} have developed an approach that accommodates the uncertainty of the data when calculating site frequency based neutrality test statistics. A salient feature of this approach is that it implicitly solves the problems of varying sequencing depth, missing data and avoids the need to infer variable sites for the analysis and thereby avoids ascertainment problems introduced by a {SNP} discovery {process.CONCLUSION:Using} an empirical Bayes approach for fast computations, we show that this method produces results for low-coverage {NGS} data comparable to those achieved when the genotypes are known without uncertainty. We also validate the method in an analysis of data from the 1000 genomes project. The method is implemented in a fast framework which enables researchers to perform these neutrality tests on a genome-wide scale.},
